## Side Note

I've configured my Window Manager to **swap Caps Lock with Escape** and _Escape with Caps Lock_, which explains why they're in unusual positions.
This setup allows me to easily access the Escape key even when using a laptop keyboard.

Configured with [oryx](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez) and the wally-cli.
